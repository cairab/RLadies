# RLadies

This repo has some example code -along with the datasets- in Python and R for the R-ladies talk that I gave: 'Data Wars: Python vs. R'

Both the R code and the Python code does the following:

1) Read pre-cleaned Iowa Housing Prices dataset.
2) Plot a heatmap with numerical variables and house sale price.
3) Do some lasso regression to find the coefficients of numerical features (feature selection).
4) Plot the coefficients.
5) Read the iris dataset.
6) Perform knn classification.
